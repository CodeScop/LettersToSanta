	        		Icelanders take Christmas very seriously. They clean their whole house from bottom to the top, decorate it with lights and Christmas decorations and put up a Christmas tree in their living room. They bake Christmas cookies, eat clementines and make a crispy flatbread called Laufabrauð in Icelandic (see the picture on the right). But mostly, Christmas traditions in Iceland is about getting together with your family. And of course enjoying good food and exchanging presents.

		        	From December 16th to Christmas Eve, children often perform the 'Posada' processions or Posadas. Posada is Spanish for Inn or Lodging. There are nine Posadas. These celebrate the part of the Christmas story where Joseph and Mary looked for somewhere to stay. For the Posadas, the outside of houses are decorated with evergreens, moss and paper lanterns.Each night a different house holds the Posada party. At the final Posada, on Christmas Eve, a manger and figures of shepherds are put on to the board. When the Posada house has been found, a baby Jesus is put into the manger and then families go to a midnight Church service. After the Church service there are more fireworks to celebrate the start of Christmas.

		        	Around Christmas time in Sweden, one of the biggest celebrations is St. Lucia's Day (or St. Lucy's Day) on December 13th. This celebration comes from stories that were told by Monks who first brought Christianity to Sweden.

		        <p class="card-text bodyText">
		        	In Sweden, presents are brought by Santa who's known as 'Jultomten' or just 'Tomten' (that mean 'The Christmas Gnome' or 'The Gnome'). He's often helped by gnomes/elves which are called 'Nissar' (male elves/gnomes) or 'Nissor' (female gnomes/elves). The end of Christmas in Sweden is on January 13th (twenty days after Christmas) which is called 'Tjugondag Knut' (Twentieth Day Knut) or 'Tjugondag jul' (Twentieth Day Yule).

		        	Christmas has only been widely celebrated in Japan for the last few decades. It's still not seen as a religious holiday or celebration as there aren't many Christians in Japan. Now several customs that came to Japan from the USA such as sending and receiving Christmas cards and presents are popular.

						<p class="card-text bodyText">
							In Japan, Christmas in known as more of a time to spread happiness rather than a religious celebration. Christmas Eve is often celebrated more than Christmas Day. Christmas Eve is thought of as a romantic day, in which couples spend together and exchange presents. In many ways it resembles Valentine's Day celebrations in the UK and the USA. Young couples like to go for walks to look at the Christmas lights and have a romantic meal in a restaurant - booking a table on Christmas Eve can be very difficult as it's so popular!

	        		For most children in The Netherlands, the most important day during December is 5th December, when Sinterklaas (St. Nicholas) brings them their presents! St. Nicholas' Day is on the 6th December, but in The Netherlands, the major celebrations are held on the 5th December, St. Nicholas' Eve. The name Santa Claus comes from the name Sinterklaas.
	        	</p>
						<p class="card-text bodyText">
							It all starts on the second Saturday of November (the first Saturday after 11th November) when Sinterklaas travels to a city or town in The Netherlands. Dutch tradition says that St. Nicholas lives in Madrid, Spain and every year he chooses a different harbour to arrive in Holland, so as many children as possible get a chance to see him.
